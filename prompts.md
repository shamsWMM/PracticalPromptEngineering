Prompt 1: Standard
```text
Create a prompt library application that lets users save and delete prompts.

Users should be able to:

Enter a title and content for their prompt
Save it to localStorage
See all their saved prompts displayed on the page
Delete prompts they no longer need
Make it look clean and professional with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
```

Prompt 2: Zero Shot
Create a prompt library application in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Create an HTML page with a form containing fields for the prompt title and content

Add a save prompt button that saves to localStorage

Display saved prompts in cards

Each prompt card should show the title, a content preview of a few words, and a delete button

Deleting should remove the prompt from localStorage and update the display

Style it with CSS to look clean and modern with a developer theme

Include all HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality in their own files, but that can be run immediately and includes no other features.
